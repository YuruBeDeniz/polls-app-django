# The reverse function is called "reverse" because it reverses the normal URL-matching process, 
# finding a URL from a view name instead of finding a view from a URL.

# request.POST is a dictionary-like object that lets you access 
# submitted data by key name. In this case, request.POST['choice'] 
# returns the ID of the selected choice, as a string. request.POST values are always strings.

# Another useful benefit of F() is that having the database - rather than Python - 
# update a fieldâ€™s value avoids a race condition.
# it will only ever update the field based on the value of the field in the database 
# when the save() or update() is executed, rather than based on its value when the instance was retrieved.
